        <h3>6d-Question 4</h3>
        Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger)
        or seniors (65 years and older).
        <ul>
            <li>Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside</li>
            <li>Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies
                for a discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console.
                Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.
                Note: Try to use the || operator in your solution.
            </li>
            <li>
                Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messages.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6e-Question 5</h3>
        Continuing from exercise 6d, let's say the discount is only available if it is not
        a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;
        <ul>
            <li>
                Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet
                the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.
            </li>
            <li>
                Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets()
                to control which code gets done first.
            </li>
            <li>
                Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

</body>

    <script>
        const age = 6;
        const isHoliday = false;
        
        if ((age <= 6 || age >= 65) && !isHoliday){
            console.log('Discount');
        }else {
            console.log('No Discount')
        }
    </script>
