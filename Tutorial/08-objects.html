        <h3>What is an object</h3>
        An objects groups multiple values together.
        Syntax:
                object{
                    property_1: value_1,
                    property_2: value_2
                }

        <h3> Why we use objects? </h3>
        Instead of creating bunch of variable like name, price, and
        other things. This will make our code lot cleaner.

        <h3>Dot notation vs Bracket</h3>
        • We can access the property by using both, but the main difference is
        bracket notation lets us use properties that don't work with dot notation.
        Let's take a below example to understand this
        <br><br>

        const property2 = {<br>
            name: 'shirt'<br>
        } <br>
        product2.name //Will work <br>
        product2.delivery-time // JS will treat this as substraction instead of 
                                single variable. In that case use below. <br> 
        product2['delivery-time'] //well thi is not a property but that is okay
                                    concet is simple. <br>
        
        <br><br>
        • Which one should we use? <br>
        - use dot notation by default <br>
        - for properties that don't work, use bracket notation <br>

        • Bracket notation can contain anything that results in a value
        other than strings like <br>
        property['variable'] <br>
        property['delivery' + 'time'] <br>

        if there is only string inside the brackets; if we removed the [] brackets
        the code will still works
        <br><br>
        • A function is another type of value, we will learn more about this later.
        For now just knows that function is another values.
        <br> Function inside object = Method Ex: console.log If we check the typeof
        console => object and typeof console.log => function. So this is a function
        inside object "console"
        <br> Another example is Math.random() => Math is object and random is func
        which is saved inside an Math object. We call Math.random() => Method

        <h3>Built in Objects</h3>
        JavaScript has built-in object like we've seen console. There are other objects
        also. Two more built-in objects JSON and localstorage, we'll use those objects
        to improve our rock, paper, scissors project.

        <ul>
            <li>JSON</li>
            <p>Helps is in JavaScript Object Notation. It is basically a syntax similiar
                to JavaScript objects but has less feature. All properties and string must
                use JSON, does not support single quote and functions.
                <br>
                • Why would we use JSON syntax?
                JavaScript object syntax only makes sense in javascript. So to talk to or
                to share information other programming languag, we use JSON.
                <br>
                JSON.stringify => returns a string. This JSON string ready to be sent to 
                another computer or ready to be save in storage.
            </p>
            <li>Local Storage</li>
            <p>
                Local storage used to save values more permanently. However variables are
                temporary.
                <br>
                localStorage => is object
                setItem => is method
                <br>
                • null vs undefined
                <br>
                null=> intentionally want something to be empty.
                <br>
                undefined =>a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a 
                value

            </p>

            <li>Auto=Boxing</li>
            <p>
                JavaScript automatically wraps a string in a special object.
                <br>
                Ex: console.log('hello'.length) => returns lenght of string
                <br> console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); => return uppercase hello
                <br>
                So 'hello' is wrapped in the special object; javascript does this
                automatically this is know as auto-boxing.
                <br>
                Auto-Boxing is works with numbers and booleans but does not work with 
                null and undefined.
            </p>

            <li> Object are Reference</li>
            If create an object like <br>
            Ex: const object1 = { <br>
                message:'hello'<br>
            } <br>
            <br>The actual value is stored in the memory, and object is reference to this
            memory location. This is like a shortcut on our computer system, it points to
            the actual memory location where it is stored. I already know about this.

            <br> One thing to note here is the eventhough we used const, we're able to
            manipulate the value of object. This is because eventhough const is preventing
            us from changing the reference the variable, but it doesn't prevent us from
            reaching into the reference and changing the object that is pointing to.

            <li>Destructuring</li>
            <p>

                It is an easier way to take properties out of an object.
            </p>
        </ul>
    </p>
