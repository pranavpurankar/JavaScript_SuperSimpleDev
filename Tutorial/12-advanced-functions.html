    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anonymous function</li>
            A function without name is known as anonymous function <br>
            Ex: const function = function (){};
            <br>Basically the function we used to write in the javascript
            like function greeting() {} is a long cut of the 
            var greeting  = function (){}. Using var is not advisiable.
            <br><br>

            <li>Hoisting</li>
            <br>Our standard javascript function syntax that is
            <br> greeting();
            <br> function greeting(){
            <br>    console.log(greeting)
            <br> }

            Hoisting means you can call the function before it's declaration
            since it dosen't matter what the order is. Function is declared
            before or after, condition is it should somewhere exists in the 
            code. That is the advantage of the this syntax.

            <li>Method</li>
            Function saved inside an object, is known as method.

            <li>Callback and Passing function into another function </li>
            The function that we are passing in is called a callback function or
            a callback. In our case run functions inupt is anonymous function 
            which is a callback. <br>
            Ex:
                <br>function run(param){
                <br>    pram(); -> param is variable bt taking input as func
                <br> }
                <br>run (function () { -> taking another func {aka callback func}
                <br>    console.log("Hello callback func")
                <br> })

            <li> JavaScript feature setTimeout()</li>
            This allows us to run a function in the future.
            <br>syntax of this built-in function
            <br> setTimeout(param1, param2)
            <br> param1 -> function that we want to run in the future
            <br> param2 -> how long to wait before running this function
            
            <li> Asynchronous and Synchronous</li>
            â€¢ Asynchronous <br>
            To understand this let's take our example of setTimeout(1000mlsc->1sec)
            <br> setTimeout(function(console.log('timeout'),2000))
            <br> console.log('next line')
            <br>output:-
            <br> next line
            <br> timeout (after 2 sec)

            <br> Why first 'next line' is printed ?
            <br> This is because js will see that setTimeout need to be executed 
            after 2 sec. So instead of waiting for 2sec it will prints first 
            "next line" and after 2 sec -> "timeout"
            <br>The setTimeout block of code is know as Asynchronous code. This 
            means that computer won't wait to finish this line before going to 
            next line. So setTimeout sets up the timeout and immediately goes to 
            the next line.
            <br> It is similiar to real-life if we setup a timer using clock; we 
            won't for timer until it finishes. We perform other tasks and timer will
            run in background.
            
            <li> Synchronous</li>
            The Synchronous code will for one line to finish before going to the
            next line to finish. All the code we have written in this course so
            far is known as Synchronous code. The code inside the setTimeout func
            is also the Synchronous code; as it will execute line by line. Don't
            get confused it is simple concept. Generally all the code we write is
            Synchronous code; it will execute line by line.
            <br> When we use certain feature from JavaScript like setTimeout; at
            that our code becomes Asynchronous.
